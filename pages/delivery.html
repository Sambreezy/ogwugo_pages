            <p class="deliveryp1">You've placed your order and now are anxiously awaiting your finished product. You can<br>view tracking information for your shipment by logging in to your Blurb account, going to the My<br>Orders page then clicking the order number.</p>
            <p class="deliveryp2">From there, you can view information about your order including the delivery-by date, destination,<br>and tracking information. </p>
            <p class="deliveryp3">If your order has shipped and there's no link to a tracking number, this means it shipped via a non-<br>trackable method. (Most shipping methods are trackable, and methods that aren't trackable will<br>show non-trackable next to the available delivery dates at check-out).</p>
            <p class="deliveryp4">Having an issue with delivery? Please contact our <a href="customer_care.html">Customer Care</a>. Include your order number in<br>your email so that we can more quickly resolve your issue.</p>
